		"content": "Some things\nWhy?\nFinancial market serves several purposes, including:\n\nRaising capital: The financial market provides a platform for companies and governments to raise funds from investors in the form of equity or debt, which can be used to finance their operations or investment projects.\nPrice discovery: The financial market facilitates the determination of the prices of financial assets, based on the supply and demand of these assets. This price discovery process helps investors and market participants make informed investment decisions.\nLiquidity: The financial market provides liquidity to investors, allowing them to easily buy and sell financial assets such as stocks, bonds, and currencies. This enables investors to quickly and easily adjust their portfolios in response to changing market conditions.\nRisk management: The financial market allows investors to hedge against risks such as market volatility, inflation, and interest rate changes, by trading financial instruments such as options, futures, and swaps.\nEconomic growth: The financial market plays a crucial role in promoting economic growth by providing capital to companies and governments, which can be used to finance new projects and create jobs. This, in turn, can lead to increased economic activity and higher standards of living for individuals.\n\nMain stakeholders\n\nInvestors: Investors are individuals or entities who provide capital to companies and governments in exchange for financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, and other securities. Investors can be individual or institutional, such as pension funds, insurance companies, and mutual funds.\nIssuers: Issuers are companies or governments that offer financial assets to investors in order to raise capital. Issuers can issue debt in the form of bonds or equity in the form of stocks.\nIntermediaries: Intermediaries are entities that facilitate the trading of financial assets between investors and issuers. Examples of intermediaries include banks, broker-dealers, and stock exchanges.\nRegulators: Regulators are government agencies that oversee the financial market to ensure that it operates fairly and efficiently. Regulators set rules and guidelines for financial institutions and investors, and monitor the market to detect and prevent fraud and misconduct.\nMarket data providers: Market data providers are entities that collect and disseminate information about the financial market, including prices, trading volume, and other market data. This information is used by investors, issuers, and regulators to make informed decisions about the market.\n\nUnderlying assumptions from Economics\n\n(1) Rational Expectations: Based on perfect information\n\nEconomic actors will not make systematic mistakes in predicting the future (risks)\nEveryone uses the «right» model for forecasting\nThe future can be inferred from the past and present\n\n(2) Efficient Financial Market Theory: Asset prices represent the best possible estimates of the risks attached to them\n\nThe risk characteristics from financial markets can be inferred from mathematical analysis.\nMarket discipline can be used as an efficient tool in constraining harmful risk taking. Markets are self-correcting.\n\nWhy vulnerable?\nThe financial market is vulnerable to a variety of factors and risks, including:\n\nSystemic risks: These are risks that affect the entire financial system, rather than individual institutions or investors. Systemic risks can arise from a variety of sources, such as market volatility, geopolitical events, or regulatory changes.\nMarket risks: Market risks refer to the risk of losses due to changes in market conditions, such as changes in interest rates, exchange rates, or commodity prices.\nCredit risks: Credit risks refer to the risk of default by borrowers or issuers of debt securities. This can be due to factors such as financial distress, economic downturns, or changes in the creditworthiness of borrowers.\nOperational risks: Operational risks refer to the risk of losses due to internal failures of financial institutions, such as fraud, errors, or system failures.\nLiquidity risks: Liquidity risks refer to the risk that investors will not be able to buy or sell financial assets at fair market value due to a lack of market liquidity. This can lead to losses or a decrease in portfolio value.\nCybersecurity risks: With the increasing use of technology in the financial market, cybersecurity risks have become a significant concern. Cyber attacks on financial institutions can lead to the loss of sensitive data, financial theft, and disruption of market activity.\nOverall, the financial market is vulnerable to a wide range of risks, and investors and financial institutions must take steps to manage these risks in order to protect themselves and the broader financial system.",

Bernoulli Zufallsvariablen X1,X2,… auf (Ω,F,P) mit Parameter 12\n\n[!info] #Theorem 2.27.\nEine Zufallsvariable U heisst gleichverteilt auf [0,1], wir schreiben U∼U([0,1]), falls ihre Verteilungsfunktion gegeben ist durch\nFU(x)={0x&lt;0x0≤x≤11x&gt;1\n\nKonstruktion von gleichverteilten Zufallsvariablen auf [0,1]\n\n[!info] #Theorem 2.28\nDie Abbildung X:Ω→[0,1] definiert in Gleichung (2.3) ist eine gleichverteilte Zufallsvariable auf [0,1].\n\n[!Info]- Beweis\nEs ist schnell sichtbar, dass für alle ω∈Ω gilt, X(ω)∈[0,1]. Somit gilt für x&lt;0, dass FX(x)=P[X≤x]=0 und für x≥1, dass FX(x)=1\nSei also x∈[0,1) und sei {xn}n∈N ihre eindeutige Binärdarstellung wie in Lemma 2.29. Dann gilt\n{X&gt;x}={X1&gt;x1}∪{{X1=x1}∩{X2&gt;x2}}∪…Also entweder ist die erste Ziffer grösser oder die erste Ziffer ist gleich und die zweite ist grösser usw.\n\n[!info] #Lemma 2.29 Binärdarstellung\nJedes x∈[0,1) kann eindeutig in der Form\nx=∑n=1∞2−nxndargestellt werden, wobei für alle n∈N gilt,xn∈{0,1}, und für jedes N∈N gibt es ein k&gt;N, sodass xk=0 (als odie Folge &quot;endet&quot; nicht in unendlich vielen 1-en.) Die Folge {xn}n∈N heisst Binärdarstellung von x und wir schreiben x=(.x1x2…)2\n\nKonstruktion von Zufallsvariablen mit beliebiger Verteilungsfunktion F\nDa wir die Gleichverteilung auf [0,1] haben, würden wir nun gerne Zufallsvariablen mit beliebiger Verteilungsfunktion konstruieren können.\nGegeben: F:R→[0,1] eine Funktion, die die Eigenschaften (i)-(iii) aus Satz 2.13 erfüllt.\nFalls F streng monoton steigend und stetig ist, dann ist F bijektiv und es existiert eine Umkehrfunktion F−1. Für jedes α∈[0,1] ist x:=F−1(α) die eindeutige reelle Zahl, für die F(x)=α gilt.\nAllgemein kann die sogenannte verallgmeinerte inverse Verteilungsfunktion oder Quantil-Funktion für F definiert werden.\n\n[!info] #Def 2.30 Verallgemeinerte inverse Verteilungsfunktion\nDie Verallgemeinerte inverse Verteilungsfunktion von F ist eine Abbildung F−1:(0,1)→R definiert durch\nF−1(α)=inf{x∈R|F(x)≥α}\nNach Definition des Infimums und unter Verwendung der Rechtsstetigkeit von F gilt für jedes x∈R und α∈(0,1), dass\nF−1(α)≤x⟺α≤F(x)\nMithile der verallgemeinerten inversen Verteilungsfunktion können wir nun Zufallsvariablen mit beliebigen Verteilungsfunktionen konstruieren.\n\n[!info] #Theorem 2.31.

Wir beheben das Problem mittels folgender Definition\nX(ω){F−1(U(ω))U(ω)∈(0,1)0sonstDabei spielt 0 selbst keine Rolle und es kann jede beliebe reelle Zahl genommen werden.\n\nallgemeine Folgen von unabhängigen Zufallsvariablen\n\n[!info] #Theorem 2.35.\nGegeben: Folge von Funktionen F1,F2 auf R→[0,1], die die Eigenschaften (i)-(iii) aus Satz 2.13 erfüllen.\nDann existiert ein Wahrscheinlichkeitsraum (Ω,F,P) und eine Folge von Zufallsvariablen X1,X2,… auf diesem Wahrscheinlichkeitsraum, sodass\n\nfür jedes k gilt, Xk hat Verteilungsfunktion Fk und\nX1,X2,… sind unabhängig.\nDieser Satz erlaubt es uns, direkt mit Zufallsvariablen zu arbeiten, ohne den Wahrscheinlichkeitsraum (Ω,F,P) genauer zu definieren.\nZ.B. können wir für zwei Verteilungsfunktionen F und G stets annehmen, dass X und Y existieren, die unabhängig sind und Verteilungsfunktionen F und G besitzen",
