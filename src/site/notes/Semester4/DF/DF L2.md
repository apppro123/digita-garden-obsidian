5. Ignore fees, how many bananas do you get when you send 10 apples to a CPMM that holds a liquidity of 30 apples and 56 bananas?
	1. How to calculate?
		1. constant product = 30 \[apples] * 56 \[bananas] = 168
		2. and afterwards there has to be the same again thus 40 (30 + 10 new) \[apples] * x \[bananas] = 168
		3. solve for x
		- alternative: calculate ratio after adding 56 \[bananas] / 40 \[apples] = 7 / 5 => now  multiply with number of apples and you get bananas 7 \[bananas] / 5 \[apples] * 10 \[apples] = 14 \[bananas]
