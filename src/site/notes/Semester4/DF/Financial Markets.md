## Some things
### Why? 
Financial market serves several purposes, including:
1. **Raising capital**: The financial market provides a platform for companies and governments to raise funds from investors in the form of equity or debt, which can be used to finance their operations or investment projects.
2. **Price discovery**: The financial market facilitates the determination of the prices of financial assets, based on the supply and demand of these assets. This price discovery process helps investors and market participants make informed investment decisions.
3. **Liquidity**: The financial market provides liquidity to investors, allowing them to easily buy and sell financial assets such as stocks, bonds, and currencies. This enables investors to quickly and easily adjust their portfolios in response to changing market conditions.
4. **Risk management**: The financial market allows investors to hedge against risks such as market volatility, inflation, and interest rate changes, by trading financial instruments such as options, futures, and swaps.
5. **Economic growth**: The financial market plays a crucial role in promoting economic growth by providing capital to companies and governments, which can be used to finance new projects and create jobs. This, in turn, can lead to increased economic activity and higher standards of living for individuals.
### Main stakeholders
1. **Investors**: Investors are individuals or entities who provide capital to companies and governments in exchange for financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, and other securities. Investors can be individual or institutional, such as pension funds, insurance companies, and mutual funds.
2. **Issuers**: Issuers are companies or governments that offer financial assets to investors in order to raise capital. Issuers can issue debt in the form of bonds or equity in the form of stocks.
3. **Intermediaries:** Intermediaries are entities that facilitate the trading of financial assets between investors and issuers. Examples of intermediaries include banks, broker-dealers, and stock exchanges.
4. **Regulators**: Regulators are government agencies that oversee the financial market to ensure that it operates fairly and efficiently. Regulators set rules and guidelines for financial institutions and investors, and monitor the market to detect and prevent fraud and misconduct.
5. **Market data providers**: Market data providers are entities that collect and disseminate information about the financial market, including prices, trading volume, and other market data. This information is used by investors, issuers, and regulators to make informed decisions about the market.
### Underlying assumptions from Economics
- (1) **Rational Expectations**: Based on perfect information
	- Economic actors will not make systematic mistakes in predicting the future (risks)
	- Everyone uses the «right» model for forecasting
	- The future can be inferred from the past and present
- (2) **Efficient Financial Market Theory**: Asset prices represent the best possible estimates of the risks attached to them
	- The risk characteristics from financial markets can be inferred from mathematical analysis.
	- Market discipline can be used as an efficient tool in constraining harmful risk taking. Markets are self-correcting.
### Why vulnerable?
The financial market is vulnerable to a variety of factors and risks, including:
1. **Systemic risks**: These are risks that affect the entire financial system, rather than individual institutions or investors. Systemic risks can arise from a variety of sources, such as market volatility, geopolitical events, or regulatory changes.
2. Market risks: Market risks refer to the risk of losses due to changes in market conditions, such as changes in interest rates, exchange rates, or commodity prices.
3. Credit risks: Credit risks refer to the risk of default by borrowers or issuers of debt securities. This can be due to factors such as financial distress, economic downturns, or changes in the creditworthiness of borrowers.
4. Operational risks: Operational risks refer to the risk of losses due to internal failures of financial institutions, such as fraud, errors, or system failures.
5. Liquidity risks: Liquidity risks refer to the risk that investors will not be able to buy or sell financial assets at fair market value due to a lack of market liquidity. This can lead to losses or a decrease in portfolio value.
6. Cybersecurity risks: With the increasing use of technology in the financial market, cybersecurity risks have become a significant concern. Cyber attacks on financial institutions can lead to the loss of sensitive data, financial theft, and disruption of market activity.
Overall, the financial market is vulnerable to a wide range of risks, and investors and financial institutions must take steps to manage these risks in order to protect themselves and the broader financial system.
