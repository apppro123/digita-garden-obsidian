- Maximal extractable value #short MEV
- Value extractable from transactions by block producers through:
	- Including
	- Excluding
	- Reordering
- default transaction ordering is per gas paid (first the one with highest gas)
- priority gas auctions
	- public bids
	- all-pay auction
		- losers pay too (wastes blockspace)
## Making money
- **atomic arbitrage** e.g. automated by a bot over two different exchanges
- **frontrunning** ![Pasted image 20240524155126.png](/img/user/Semester4/DF/Lectures/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240524155126.png)
- **sandwiching** ![Pasted image 20240524155219.png](/img/user/Semester4/DF/Lectures/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240524155219.png)
	- sandwiching = bad execution![Pasted image 20240525160137.png](/img/user/Semester4/DF/Lectures/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240525160137.png)
		- because bots go to the edge of the possible to maximise profit
- **consensus instability** by having very powerful miners ![Pasted image 20240525160605.png](/img/user/Semester4/DF/Lectures/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240525160605.png)

	- stores a number and allows anyone to read and modify it
	- stores a number and allows only the contract owner to read and modify it
	- allows anyone to become the owner and read and modify the number
	- allows anyone to read the number but only the contract owner can modify it. \[correct]
- Which of the following functions do not modify state?
	- using selfdestruct
	- sending Ether via calls
	- reading from state variables \[correct]
	- calling any function not marked pure or view
- What are the required functions that must be implemented by an ERC20-compliant token?

	- buy(), withdraw(), getTokens(), allow(), deposit()
	- create(), send(), getBalance(), authorize(), receive()

- What is the purpose of a fallback function in a smart contract?
	- to replace all function calls when there is an out of gas error
	- to provide a default function that is called when no other function matches the function call \[correct]
	- to handle errors that occur during contract execution
	- to prevent reentrancy attacks by pausing execution until the current function call completes
