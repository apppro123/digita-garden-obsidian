- In the area of [mathematical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic "Mathematical logic") and [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science") known as [type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory "Type theory"), a **unit type** is a [type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type "Data type") that allows only one value (and thus can hold no information)
## Programming languages
### Haskell
> The `()` type can be thought of as a zero-element tuple. It's a type that can only have one value, and thus it's used where you need to have a type, but you don't actually need to convey any information. Here's a couple of uses for this.
