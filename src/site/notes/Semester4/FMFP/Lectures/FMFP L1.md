## Functional programming
- basic concepts
	- function (which are values itself) #aka first order citizens
	- values
- example programming languages: Haskell
### Advantages
- easier to reason about bc. no state (changes) anymore
	- no side effects
- **referential transparency** every expression with same values evaluate to same expressions
- **recursion instead of iteration**
- **Flexible type system**: many programming errors not possible (compile time error) e.g. 3 + TRUE, polymorphism supports reusability
